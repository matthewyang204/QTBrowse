# QTBrowse
 A python-based browser built from Python and PyQT5

 Installation:
 1. Download the source code for the version you want to use
 2. Make sure PyQt5, PyQt5-sip, and PyQt5WebEngine are installed with pip3
 3. Launch the main script with Python Launcher, or enter the directory and type `sh ./qtbrowse.sh` in a terminal window

Note: This doesn't work with pyinstaller binaries for some reason. Report in an issue if you find a solution
